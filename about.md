I'm Erica, hi!

I hack on Linux, containers, and serverless. I see code-as-deploy as delivering on the promise of microkernels... that operating systems such as Linux will become increasingly abstracted away, and that we will need fewer and less complex operating systems.

I was an early contributor and core developer of OpenStack, and an early employee, developer, and maintainer of Docker where I also founded their security team and processes.

Chromebooks are awesome. They're secure and disposable, should their security be compromised or suspect. You should have at least one.

I believe in intersectional feminism.

Otherwise... read my blog,
